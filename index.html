        <p>I’m Huan Hong Nguyen (Noah), a dedicated researcher and project leader with a strong background in
            Management (MBA) and Information Technology (Computer Science). My research journey is enriched by practical
            experience across diverse fields, and I hold a Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification,
            underscoring my skills in strategic project management and leadership.</p>

        <p>Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, my research explores topics at the intersection of
            technology and human development, with a particular focus on information systems and cybersecurity, privacy
            and human-computer interaction, the future of work and human factors, as well as social networks and digital
            entrepreneurship.</p>


        <p>I employ a diverse range of research methodologies, including cross-sectional studies, behavioral surveys,
            longitudinal studies, econometrics, and advanced techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
            Learning (ML). My toolkit encompasses tools such as SPSS, AMOS, SmartPLS, and VOSviewer, along with data
            analysis platforms like Python and R to support rigorous data-driven insights.</p>

        <p>With a solid portfolio of publications and ongoing research projects, I am dedicated to advancing academic
            and industry knowledge in technology management and policy. I have led impactful projects on privacy law,
            digital entrepreneurship, and the effects of flexible work models on employee outcomes. My work has been
            published in journals including <em>Computers in Human Behavior</em>, <em>Technological Forecasting and
                Social Change</em>, and <em>SAGE Open</em>; conferences proceedings such as <em>ICB2021</em>,
            <em>ICBI2022</em>,
            <em>Transportation Research Procedia</em>, and <em>ICIS 2024</em>.
        </p>

        <p>I have actively contributed to the academic community through my role as an ad-hoc journal reviewer for
            <em>The International Journal of Management Education</em>, where I provide rigorous peer reviews to support
            the quality and relevance of research in management education. Additionally, I serve as an ad-hoc conference
            reviewer for the <em>Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2024 (ACIS 2024)</em>, ensuring that
            high standards are maintained for research presentations in the field of information systems.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting and sharing insights in the fields of technology,
            research, and human development.</p>
